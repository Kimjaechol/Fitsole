## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Scanning is Phase 2 (highest-risk component validated before downstream investment)
- [Roadmap]: Insole design coupled with product catalog (Phase 3) per shoe-insole compatibility requirement
- [Phase 01]: Used next/font/local for Pretendard instead of CDN for optimal CLS performance
- [Phase 01]: Pinned next-auth to 5.0.0-beta.30 for stability over @latest tag
- [Phase 01]: Used bcryptjs (pure JS) over argon2 for serverless compatibility
- [Phase 01]: Removed horizontal padding from (main) layout for full-bleed landing sections
- [Phase 01]: Password reset always returns 200 regardless of email existence (user enumeration prevention)
- [Phase 01]: Auth layout uses SessionProvider wrapper; Resend email with console.log dev fallback
- [Phase 01]: EmptyState component uses Lucide icons at 64px with muted color for consistent empty state UX
- [Phase 01]: Reorder button uses aria-disabled and pointer-events-none for accessible disabled state
- [Phase 01]: Account deletion shows toast (v1 not implemented) rather than error

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Factory partner not yet identified -- needed before Phase 5 execution
- MediaPipe foot landmark accuracy unvalidated -- critical risk for Phase 2
